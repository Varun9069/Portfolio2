## Recent Project
### Do Expectations of Upward Social Mobility Post Covid-19 Predict Higher Life Satisfaction?

- In times of socioeconomic and health system stability, higher social mobility expectations are associated with greater life satisfaction (Dolan et al., 2020).
- However, it is unclear whether the future uncertainty caused by a global health crises affects this relationship. 
- Using data collected immediately after COVID-19, I investigated the relationship between social mobility expectations and life satisfaction while taking resilience into account by using multiple regression. Sex differences were also considered. 

### Approach

- ICPSR open source dataset; 2022 US National Wellbeing Survey, completed between May 10 - September 5, 2022 () 
- A cross sectional study involving 5,666 adults (ages 18-64).
- Variables analyzed include resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), life satisfaction (SWLS), mobility expectations and sex  

### Does Ingroup Prejudice Hurt Asian Americans More?

- We examined how Asian Americans feel after experiencing ingroup prejudice (i.e., prejudice that comes from ingroup members)
- Results showed that Asian Americans who were rejected by Asian peers felt less positive towards Asians compared to their baseline attitudes, whereas experiencing prejudice from White peers did not change participantsâ€™ attitudes towards Whites
- Expectation and prejudice attribution are not related to this difference

### Do People Hold More Prejudice Towards Bisexual Singles?

- We asked people to rate single people with different sexual orientation backgrounds and found that people's assumptions about bisexual single people are more negative than gay/lesbian single people 
- This prejudice primarily comes from non-single people 
- The belief that bisexual people have more choices of potential dating partners partially explains the rating

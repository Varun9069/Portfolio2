### Do Expectations of Upward Social Mobility Post Covid-19 Predict Higher Life Satisfaction?

- In times of socioeconomic and health system stability, higher social mobility expectations are associated with greater life satisfaction (Dolan et al., 2020).
- However, it is unclear whether the future uncertainty caused by a global health crises affects this relationship. 
- Using data collected immediately after COVID-19, I investigated the relationship between social mobility expectations and life satisfaction while taking resilience into account by using multiple regression. Sex differences were also considered. 

### Approach

- ICPSR open source dataset; 2022 US National Wellbeing Survey, completed between May 10 - September 5, 2022. 
- A cross sectional study involving 5,666 adults (ages 18-64).
- Relationship between resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), life satisfaction (SWLS) and mobility expectations was analyzed. Sex differences were explored separately for resilience and life satisfaction.

### Results

#### Main Finding
- Mobility expectations and resilience independently predicted life satisfaction.
- Resilience was a stronger predictor of life satisfaction.
- Higher mobility expectations predicted lower life satisfaction, even after taking resilience into account

#### Sex Differences: Resilience 
- The effect of resilience on life satisfaction differed by sex.
- The effect of resilience on life satisfaction was strongest for males and weakest for those identifying as "other".

### Impact

- A previous study identified *purpose seeking* as the link between higher mobility expectations and greater life satisfaction (Lin et al., 2022). 
- In the present study, the relationship between higher social mobility expectations and greater life satisfaction was reversed after COVID-19.
- Taken together, this suggests future research should investigate a potential change in motivation for holding mobility beliefs in times of socio-economic or health system uncertainty.
